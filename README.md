# Asset-Allocation-with-Hierarchical-Risk-Parity-and-GARCH-DECO-DCC-simulation
This project examines some common solutions to the classical optimal portfolio construction problem proposed by Markowitz(1952). Algorithms are based on financial machine learning concepts, namely, hierarchical risk parity and GARCH-DCC, GARCH- DECO (time series modelling). We test these frameworks on the universe of 43 assets of our choice and give detailed comparison between them. Sharpe ratio and annual volatility were the performance measures of our focus. Our findings show that, for this particular portfolio, HRP method efficiently decreases out-of-sample variance and indeed provides us with a stable and diversified portfolio.
